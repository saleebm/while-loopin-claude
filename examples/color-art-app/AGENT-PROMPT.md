# Improve the Color Art Canvas App

You are working on a fun HTML5 canvas animation (`index.html`).

## Current State
The app shows a simple HSLA color wheel with:
- 6 rotating rainbow circles
- Click interaction that spawns particle bursts
- Basic animation loop with trail effects

## Your Mission
Transform this into something more visually impressive! Here are some ideas:

### Visual Enhancements
1. **More complex patterns** - Spirals, fractals, mandalas, kaleidoscopes
2. **Better color schemes** - Gradients, color cycling, complementary colors
3. **Particle systems** - Smoke, fire, stars, sparkles, flowing effects
4. **Geometric art** - Sacred geometry, tessellations, morphing shapes

### Interactivity
1. **Mouse tracking** - Follow cursor, repel/attract to mouse
2. **UI controls** - Buttons to switch modes, sliders for parameters
3. **Keyboard shortcuts** - Different keys trigger different effects
4. **Audio reactive** - Respond to sound/music (optional)

### Animation Features
1. **Multiple modes** - Switch between different animation styles
2. **Smooth transitions** - Morph between patterns
3. **Randomization** - Generative art that evolves
4. **Performance** - Smooth 60fps animations

## Guidelines
- Keep it visual and impressive - changes should be immediately obvious!
- Maintain good performance (60fps)
- All code stays in `index.html` (self-contained)
- The app opens directly in browser, no build step
- Make it dopamine-inducing! 💚

## Success Criteria
Opening `index.html` in a browser should show something noticeably more awesome and visually impressive than the current simple color wheel!

Be creative and make it beautiful! 🎨✨
