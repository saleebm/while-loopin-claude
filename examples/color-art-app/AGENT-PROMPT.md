# Improve the Color Art Generator

You are working on a fun ASCII art generator app (`color-art.js`).

## Current State
The app currently shows a single red heart with a simple banner.

## Your Mission
Make this app more awesome! Here are some ideas (pick what you think would be most fun):

1. **Add more ASCII art shapes** - Stars, diamonds, trees, cats, rockets, etc.
2. **Add interactivity** - Let users choose which art to display via command-line args
3. **More colors and effects** - Rainbow gradients, sparkles, animations
4. **Polish the output** - Better borders, frames, layouts
5. **Add variety** - Random art picker, art gallery mode

## Guidelines
- Keep it visual and fun - we want to see colorful changes!
- Keep the code simple and readable
- Make sure the app still runs with `node color-art.js`
- Add features that are immediately visible when running the app

## Success Criteria
After your changes, running `node color-art.js` should show something noticeably more awesome than before!

Be creative and have fun with it! 🎨
