# Agent Handoff - Color Art App

## Session End
Status: starting

## Current State
Clean starting point with a simple HSLA color wheel animation:
- 6 rotating rainbow circles
- Click interaction spawns particle bursts
- Smooth animations with trail effects
- Canvas fills entire viewport

## Files
- `index.html` - Main app (canvas-based animation)
- `AGENT-PROMPT.md` - Task description for agent
- `run-agent-live.sh` - Enhanced runner with live preview

## Next Steps
1. Run the live agent: `bash examples/color-art-app/run-agent-live.sh`
2. Watch in browser as Claude improves the animation
3. See changes in real-time with progress overlay

## Goal
Transform the simple color wheel into something more impressive - could be:
- More complex patterns (spirals, fractals, mandalas)
- Interactive controls (sliders, buttons, color pickers)
- Multiple animation modes (switch between effects)
- Responsive to mouse movement or audio
- Generative art with randomization

Ready for Claude to make it awesome! 🎨
