I need to provide a framework for the agents to work that enforces them to update context files containing a complete list of their instructions for the phase of the plan that they are executing and enforce maintenance of  in order to track progress findings or thoughts and any relevant recent achievements and how those achievements were validated most importantly. A master  keeping track of the multi phase  agents that are   with the main agent will be  outside of the duration and control all of the  from  to  these agents  their duties from the multiple phases of the program provided by the planning agent that is separate from the main agent we must keep  prompt  everything else that is implemented in the code already as it is and only  on top of it without causing any kind of regression as minimal changes as possible focus focusing on simplicity and building up upon the main fundamental first principles of the app. I'm sure you understand the rules and how they apply to what I'm asking of you separate out all of the lines of instructions that are not necessarily lines but boundaries that you are expected to build into a plan as composed in such a way that creates what we need as a pattern for all of the sub directories in there which has already been templated and you are too use your research of the code based and findings to properly layout the plan multi phase master agent parentheses don't be racist end parentheses. 

Copied my exact prompt Word for Word to the top of the first file that you create or just a text file inside of the dot spec folder create an initialization prompt that uses the Claude agent loop which we are building on top of and that you find in the code Bass and is the whole purpose of the code base which we are building with itself like a programming language but many many abstractions higher. So what we'll do is run the Claude agent to build what I am asking and providing the plan you are to now create and for now just adding a simple  into the run  iterations that tells them to create shared context files of their work progress and stuff that I've mentioned before. Also make sure to break apart this  without losing any of the texting and then  text into achievable measurements and direct instructions applying what you see and learn from interacting with the code right now. Remember to only do these tasks and not begin any kind  work until I approve of this plan
