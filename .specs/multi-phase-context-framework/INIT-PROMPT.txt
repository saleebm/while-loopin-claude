# Initialize Multi-Phase Context Framework Implementation

## Your Task

Read the plan files in `.specs/multi-phase-context-framework/` and implement the framework according to the breakdown.

## Start Here

1. Read `PLAN.md` - Overall implementation plan
2. Read `TASK-BREAKDOWN.md` - Detailed measurable tasks
3. Start with Phase 1, Task 1.1.1: Add context file instruction to agent loop

## Key Principles

- Preserve ALL existing functionality
- Only ADD code, don't modify core logic unnecessarily  
- Build on existing patterns (use `run_claude()`, `generate_structured_output()`)
- Test after each change
- Keep changes minimal

## Implementation Order

1. **Phase 1**: Context file system (foundation)
2. **Phase 2**: Master agent framework (orchestration)
3. **Phase 3**: Integration (preservation)
4. **Phase 4**: Pattern template (reusability)

## First Steps

1. Create `lib/context-functions.sh` with `ensure_context_structure()` function
2. Modify `lib/agent-runner.sh` to call context structure creation
3. Modify `generate_continuation_prompt()` to include context file instructions
4. Test: Run single agent and verify context files created

## Success Criteria

- Context files created automatically
- Master agent can coordinate phases
- Zero regressions in existing functionality
- Pattern reusable across `.specs/` directories

Begin implementation now, starting with Phase 1.
